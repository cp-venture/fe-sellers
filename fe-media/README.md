# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading Linux distribution.
* All Bitnami images available in Docker Hub are signed with [Docker Content Trust (DCT)](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/trust/content_trust/). You can use `DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1` to verify the integrity of the images.
* Bitnami container images are released daily with the latest distribution packages available.

# How to deploy Ghost in Kubernetes?

Deploying Bitnami applications as Helm Charts is the easiest way to get started with our applications on Kubernetes. Read more about the installation in the [Bitnami Ghost Chart GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/ghost).

Bitnami containers can be used with [Kubeapps](https://kubeapps.com/) for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters.

# Prerequisites

To run this application you need Docker Engine 1.10.0. Docker Compose is recomended with a version 1.6.0 or later.

# How to use this image

### Run the application using Docker Compose

The main folder of this repository contains a functional [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ghost/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file. Run the application using it as shown below:

```console
$ curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ghost/master/docker-compose.yml > docker-compose.yml
$ docker-compose up -d
```

### Run the application manually

If you want to run the application manually instead of using docker-compose, these are the basic steps you need to run:

1. Create a new network for the application and the database:

  ```console
  $ docker network create ghost-tier
  ```

2. Create a volume for MariaDB persistence and create a MariaDB container

  ```console
  $ docker volume create --name mariadb_data
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e MARIADB_USER=bn_ghost \
    -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_ghost \
    --net ghost-tier \
    --volume mariadb_data:/bitnami \
    bitnami/mariadb:latest
  ```

   *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Ghost to resolve the host

3. Create volumes for Ghost persistence and launch the container

  ```console
  $ docker volume create --name ghost_data
  $ docker run -d --name ghost -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_USER=bn_ghost \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_ghost \
    --net ghost-tier \
    --volume ghost_data:/bitnami \
    bitnami/ghost:latest
  ```

Access your application at http://your-ip/

> **Note!** If you want to access your application from a public IP or hostname you need to properly configured Ghost . You can handle it adjusting the configuration of the instance by setting the environment variable `GHOST_HOST` to your public IP or hostname.

## Persisting your application

If you remove the container all your data and configurations will be lost, and the next time you run the image the database will be reinitialized. To avoid this loss of data, you should mount a volume that will persist even after the container is removed.

For persistence you should mount a volume at the `/bitnami` path. Additionally you should mount a volume for [persistence of the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#persisting-your-database).

The above examples define docker volumes namely `mariadb_data` and `ghost_data`. The Ghost application state will persist as long as these volumes are not removed.

To avoid inadvertent removal of these volumes you can [mount host directories as data volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/). Alternatively you can make use of volume plugins to host the volume data.

### Mount host directories as data volumes with Docker Compose

This requires a minor change to the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ghost/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
services:
  mariadb:
  ...
    volumes:
      - /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami
  ...
  ghost:
  ...
    volumes:
      - '/path/to/ghost-persistence:/bitnami'
  ...
```

### Mount host directories as data volumes using the Docker command line

In this case you need to specify the directories to mount on the run command. The process is the same than the one previously shown:

1. Create a network (if it does not exist):

  ```console
  $ docker network create ghost-tier
  ```

2. Create a MariaDB container with host volume:

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name mariadb --net ghost-tier \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e MARIADB_USER=bn_ghost \
    -e MARIADB_DATABASE=bitnami_ghost \
    --volume /path/to/mariadb-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/mariadb:latest
  ```

  *Note:* You need to give the container a name in order to Ghost to resolve the host

3. Create the Ghost container with host volumes:

  ```console
  $ docker run -d --name ghost -p 80:2368 \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_USER=bn_ghost \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_ghost \
    -e GHOST_HOST=localhost \
    --net ghost-tier \
    --volume /path/to/ghost-persistence:/bitnami \
    bitnami/ghost:latest
  ```

> NOTE: As this is a non-root container, the mounted files and directories must have the proper permissions for the UID `1001`.

# Upgrade this application

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of MariaDB and Ghost, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container. We will cover here the upgrade of the Ghost container. For the MariaDB upgrade see https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb/blob/master/README.md#upgrade-this-image

1. Get the updated images:

  ```console
  $ docker pull bitnami/ghost:latest
  ```

2. Stop your container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose stop ghost`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker stop ghost`

3. Take a snapshot of the application state

```console
$ rsync -a /path/to/ghost-persistence /path/to/ghost-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

Additionally, [snapshot the MariaDB data](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-mariadb#step-2-stop-and-backup-the-currently-running-container)

You can use these snapshots to restore the application state should the upgrade fail.

4. Remove the currently running container

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose rm ghost`
 * For manual execution: `$ docker rm ghost`

5. Run the new image

 * For docker-compose: `$ docker-compose up ghost`
 * For manual execution ([mount](#mount-persistent-folders-manually) the directories if needed): `docker run --name ghost bitnami/ghost:latest`

# Configuration

## Setting a custom storage adapters

This example shows how to install the [Storage Adapter for S3](https://github.com/colinmeinke/ghost-storage-adapter-s3#ghost-storage-adapter-s3).

```Dockerfile
FROM bitnami/ghost:latest

USER root

RUN install_packages jq
RUN mkdir -p /.npm && chmod -R g+rwX,o+rw /.npm

COPY post_ghost_config.sh /
RUN chmod +x /post_ghost_config.sh \
    && cp /app-entrypoint.sh /tmp/app-entrypoint.sh \
    && sed '/info "Starting ghost... "/ a . /post_ghost_config.sh' /tmp/app-entrypoint.sh > /app-entrypoint.sh

ENV AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" \
    AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY="AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY" \
    AWS_REGION="AWS_REGION" \
    AWS_BUCKET="AWS_BUCKET"

USER 1001

RUN cd /bitnami/ghost \
    && npm i --silent ghost-storage-adapter-s3 \
    && mkdir -p /bitnami/ghost/content/adapters/storage/s3 \
    && cp -r ./node_modules/ghost-storage-adapter-s3/* /bitnami/ghost/content/adapters/storage/s3/
```

1. Add `jq` tool, prepare npm and install an adapter.

2. Add configuration for the adapter.

**Create a script using `jq` for adding configuration to the `config.production.json`.**

```console
#!/bin/bash -e
cp /bitnami/ghost/config.production.json /tmp/config.tmp.json

jq -r --arg keyId $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID --arg accessKey $AWS_ACCESS_SECRET_KEY --arg region $AWS_REGION --arg bucket $AWS_BUCKET \
    '. + { storage: { active: "s3", s3: { accessKeyId: $keyId, secretAccessKey: $accessKey, region: $region, bucket: $bucket } } }' \
    /tmp/config.tmp.json > /bitnami/ghost/config.production.json
```

**Add it to the `app-entrypoint.sh` just after ghost is configured.**

Finally, build the container and set the required environment variables to configure the adapter.

## Environment variables

When you start the ghost image, you can adjust the configuration of the instance by passing one or more environment variables either on the docker-compose file or on the `docker run` command line. If you want to add a new environment variable:

 * For Docker Compose, add the variable name and value under the application section:

```yaml
ghost:
  ...
  environment:
    - GHOST_HOST=my_host
  ...
```

 * For manual execution add a `-e` option with each variable and value:

```console
 $ docker run -d -p 80:2368 --name ghost --network=ghost-tier \
    -e GHOST_PASSWORD=my_password \
    -v /your/local/path/bitnami/ghost:/bitnami \
    bitnami/ghost
```

Available variables:

##### User and Site configuration
- `GHOST_HOST`: Hostname for Ghost.
- `GHOST_PORT_NUMBER`: Port number used in the generated application URLs. Default: **80**
- `GHOST_PROTOCOL`: Protocol to use in the application URLs. Valid values are "http" and "https". Default: **http**
- `GHOST_USERNAME`: Ghost application username. Default: **user**
- `GHOST_PASSWORD`: Ghost application password. Minimum length is 10 characters. Default: **bitnami123**
- `GHOST_EMAIL`: Ghost application email. Default: **user@example.com**
- `BLOG_TITLE`: Ghost blog title. Default: **User's Blog**

##### Use an existing database

- `MARIADB_HOST`: Hostname for MariaDB server. Default: **mariadb**
- `MARIADB_PORT_NUMBER`: Port used by MariaDB server. Default: **3306**

 - `SMTP_HOST`: SMTP host.
 - `SMTP_PORT`: SMTP port.
 - `SMTP_USER`: SMTP account user.
 - `SMTP_PASSWORD`: SMTP account password.
 - `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`: SMTP from address.
 - `SMTP_SERVICE`: SMTP service to use.

This would be an example of SMTP configuration using a GMail account:

 * Change the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-ghost/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file present in this repository:

```yaml
ghost:
  ...
  environment:
    - SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
    - SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com
    - SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password
    - SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS="'Custom Name' <myemail@address.com>"
    - SMTP_SERVICE=GMail
  ...
```

 * For manual execution:

```console
 $ docker run -d -p 80:2368 --name ghost --network=ghost-tier \
    -e GHOST_HOST=localhost \
    -e ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_USER=bn_ghost \
    -e GHOST_DATABASE_NAME=bitnami_ghost \
    -e SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com \
    -e SMTP_SERVICE=GMail \
    -e SMTP_USER=your_email@gmail.com \
    -e SMTP_PASSWORD=your_password \
    -v /your/local/path/bitnami/ghost:/bitnami \
    bitnami/ghost
```

# Notable Changes

## 0.11.10-r2

- The ghost container has been migrated to a non-root container approach. Previously the container run as `root` user and the ghost daemon was started as `ghost` user. From now own, both the container and the ghost daemon run as user `1001`.
  As a consequence, the configuration files are writable by the user running the ghost process.
